ToDo:
1. Write code to list constraints selected by user
2. Record survey answers (which might perhaps reveal the approach recommended most often, or the most "typical" user data)
3. Add Google Analytics
4. Add link to github page, so people know where to find the code

Notes:
1. "Estimation" is synonymous with regression in this model
2. "Base" code was generated via Jupyter notebook, but the javascript function needs to process NaNs -- this modification was done by hand
